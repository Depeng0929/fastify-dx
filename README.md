**Introduction**

</h2>

**Fastify DX** is heavily inspired by **[fastify-cli]()**. 
  
It allows you get **up and running** with a [Fastify]() application without worrying about the basic setup, which is handled for you behind the scenes, in a clean and highly customizable manner.
  
It's also heavily inspired by **[Next.js]()** and **[Nuxt.js]()** â€” it supports **SSR** and **SSG** out-of-the-box, it employs **convention over configuration** where possible and it **automates bundling**.
  
Besides **preconfiguring your server** with sensible but **overridable defaults**, it has **developer-friendly logs and hot reload**.

<h2>

**Motivation**

</h2>

The main problem it tries to solve is enabling **fast application development** with a heightened focus on **Developer Experience** without **compromising on performance and stability**. 
  
It also aims to **reduce complexity** and **vendor lock-in**, effectively acting as **extremely lightweight glue code** for automating Fastify configuration and **Vite** integration, with a **fully ejectable** runtime.

<h2>

**Limitations**

</h2>

Built for [Node.js]() **v16** and above. No other platforms supported.
  
Only the [Vue 3]() adapter is currently **stable** â€” [React]() and [Solid]() adapters are in the works.

Full [TypeScript]() support is planned but not yet available.
